Here's exactly how a 28Ã—28 image gets distributed across 4 workers through each CNN layer:

#### **Input Layer: 28Ã—28Ã—1**

```

```

#### **MaxPooling 1: 26Ã—26Ã—32 â†’ 13Ã—13Ã—32**

```

```

#### **GELU Activation: 13Ã—13Ã—32 â†’ 13Ã—13Ã—32**

```
Operation: Element-wise GELU activation

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow Patterns

### Memory Access Patterns

1. **Sequential Access**: Row-major image data for good cache locality
2. **Parallel Regions**: Non-overlapping memory writes to prevent conflicts
3. **Shared Reads**: Multiple workers reading same input data efficiently
4. **Exclusive Writes**: Each worker writes to unique output regions

### Synchronization Points

1. **Layer Boundaries**: All workers must complete before next layer starts
2. **Result Gathering**: Consolidation requires all partial results
3. **Memory Barriers**: Ensure cache consistency across workers
4. **Load Balancing**: Monitor worker completion times for optimization

### Worker Communication

1. **Minimal Inter-Worker Communication**: Each worker operates independently
2. **Result Consolidation**: Simple concatenation or summation operations
3. **Shared Memory**: Efficient data sharing for read-only inputs
4. **Cache Coherency**: Automatic hardware-level synchronization

## âš¡ Performance Results

Based on actual measurements from our demo:

### Speedup Analysis

```
Linear Layers: 3.19x speedup (best case)
- High compute-to-memory ratio
- Good parallel efficiency
- Minimal synchronization overhead

Convolution Layers: 1.5x speedup (moderate)
- Memory bandwidth limitations
- Kernel size effects
- Cache misses impact

Activation Functions: 1.2x speedup (limited)
- Memory-bound operations
- Low arithmetic intensity
- Overhead from parallelization
```

### Memory Bandwidth Utilization

```
Peak Usage: ~75% of available bandwidth
Bottlenecks: Memory access patterns, cache misses
Optimizations: Tiled access, prefetching, data locality
```

## ðŸ“Š Key Takeaways

### When Parallelism Works Best

1. **Compute-Intensive Operations**: Linear layers, large convolutions
2. **Independent Work**: Non-overlapping data regions
3. **Sufficient Data**: Large enough tensors to justify overhead
4. **Good Data Locality**: Sequential memory access patterns

### Potential Limitations

1. **Memory Bandwidth**: Can become the bottleneck
2. **Synchronization Overhead**: Must balance with computation
3. **Load Balancing**: Workers should finish at similar times
4. **Hardware Constraints**: Number of cores, cache sizes

### Best Practices

1. **Profile First**: Measure before optimizing
2. **Consider Data Movement**: Minimize memory transfers
3. **Batch Operations**: Combine small operations when possible
4. **Monitor Efficiency**: Track actual speedups achieved
