   Matrix Operations Mastery:

âœ… Exact arithmetic: See how 9.1 = (1Ã—0.1 + 2Ã—0.2 + 3Ã—0.3 + 4Ã—0.4 + 5Ã—0.5 + 6Ã—0.6)
âœ… Broadcasting: How bias [1,2,3,4] gets added to every matrix row
âœ… GELU calculation: Element-wise formula with xÂ³ terms and tanh functions
âœ… Work distribution: Each of 4 workers processes 4 rows (201,216 operations each)
âœ… Memory patterns: Row-major layout enabling cache-friendly sequential access
Parallelism Understanding:

ðŸ”„ Sequential: Process each element one by one (16 steps)
ðŸ”€ Parallel: Split work across workers (4 workers, 4 rows each)
âš¡ Vectorized: Hardware-optimized single operation
ðŸ§  Memory efficiency: Cache lines, contiguous access, BLAS optimization
The programs demonstrate that whether you use sequential, parallel, or vectorized approaches, the mathematical results are identical - but the performance and resource utilization differ dramatically.
